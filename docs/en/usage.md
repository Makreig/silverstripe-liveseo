## Using this module

This modules helps the administrator of the Silverstripe website in getting good results in search engines.
A rating of the SEO of the current page helps the website editor creating good content around a subject
of the page which can be defined using a google suggest field.

The fields for meta data in pages will be moved to a SEO part by this module.
This is done for giving a realtime preview on the google search result of the page. 

In seo.yml config file you can specify which classes will NOT use the module. 
By default every class extending Page will use the SEO module.

Caution: The new master branch is not compatible with old releases see [this pull request](https://github.com/hubertusanton/silverstripe-seo/pull/10) from [jonom](https://github.com/jonom) (thanks!).

Please use tag 1.1 in old sites with the old config and tag 2.0 for new projects, but updating to 2.0 will also fix google suggest and has some other fixes.
